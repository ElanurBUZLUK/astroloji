## Introduction

The Advanced Interpretation Engine is a sophisticated astrological analysis system that combines multiple computational components to generate accurate, contextual, and personalized astrological interpretations. The system integrates a scoring algorithm, conflict resolution mechanism, output composition engine, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to deliver high-quality astrological insights with proper citations and confidence scoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an astrologer using the system, I want accurate scoring of astrological factors, so that the most significant planetary influences are properly weighted in interpretations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating planetary scores THEN the system SHALL apply base scoring algorithms for each planetary factor
2. WHEN evaluating planetary dignity THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate multiplier factors for sect, dignity, reception, and orb
3. WHEN calculating time-lord alignments THEN the system SHALL generate time-lord harmony scores based on current transits and progressions
4. IF a planet is in its own sign or exaltation THEN the system SHALL increase the base score by the dignity multiplier
5. WHEN orb distances are calculated THEN the system SHALL apply decreasing weight factors as orb distances increase

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want conflict resolution between competing astrological factors, so that contradictory interpretations are properly prioritized and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple planetary factors conflict THEN the system SHALL apply priority rules to resolve contradictions
2. WHEN evaluating planetary importance THEN the system SHALL prioritize Almuten, Lights (Sun/Moon), and Angles in that order
3. WHEN filtering transits THEN the system SHALL prioritize approaching transits over separating transits
4. IF multiple interpretations contradict THEN the system SHALL select the interpretation with the highest combined score
5. WHEN resolving conflicts THEN the system SHALL maintain a log of resolution decisions for transparency

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an end user, I want well-structured and personalized interpretation outputs, so that I receive coherent and meaningful astrological insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating interpretations THEN the system SHALL use structured text templates for consistent formatting
2. WHEN composing outputs THEN the system SHALL inject appropriate archetypal language based on planetary combinations
3. WHEN presenting results THEN the system SHALL include confidence scores for each interpretation segment
4. IF confidence scores are below threshold THEN the system SHALL indicate uncertainty in the output
5. WHEN multiple interpretation elements exist THEN the system SHALL compose them into a coherent narrative flow

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user seeking detailed astrological information, I want access to comprehensive knowledge through RAG system integration, so that interpretations are backed by traditional and modern astrological sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retrieving astrological knowledge THEN the system SHALL use vector database integration for semantic search
2. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL support both Turkish and English language expansion
3. WHEN ranking results THEN the system SHALL implement hybrid retrieval combining dense vectors and BM25 scoring
4. IF multiple sources provide information THEN the system SHALL use re-ranking to prioritize most relevant content
5. WHEN presenting information THEN the system SHALL include proper citations for all retrieved knowledge

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want query expansion capabilities, so that astrological searches return comprehensive and contextually relevant results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing user queries THEN the system SHALL expand queries using synonyms in both Turkish and English
2. WHEN generating hypothetical documents THEN the system SHALL implement HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) for better retrieval
3. IF query terms are ambiguous THEN the system SHALL provide multiple expansion variations
4. WHEN expanding astrological terms THEN the system SHALL maintain domain-specific terminology accuracy
5. WHEN processing multilingual content THEN the system SHALL handle cross-language semantic matching

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance specialist, I want re-ranking and citation management, so that the most accurate and well-sourced information appears first in results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ranking search results THEN the system SHALL use cross-encoder models for semantic re-ranking
2. WHEN filtering content THEN the system SHALL apply context-based filtering to remove irrelevant results
3. WHEN managing citations THEN the system SHALL track and format source references properly
4. IF multiple sources cite the same information THEN the system SHALL consolidate citations appropriately
5. WHEN presenting ranked results THEN the system SHALL maintain transparency in ranking decisions
